# About URSANODE

URSANODE is a collection of working code modules, targeting Javascript interactive development using HTML5 and NodeJS. It is probably most useful for programmers with an "intermediate" level of expertise, and for programmers who are exploring software design patterns. While URSANODE is my "learning code base", I think it's solid enough to be helpful to people with prior development experience.

## Quick Start

You'll need to download the repo to your working development directory, then make sure that you have the necessary command line build tools installed. I have [Macintosh setup instructions](docs/10-tools/1-install.md) available; Linux and Windows 10/WSL should work similarly but I have not yet confirmed they work.

Once you have everything installed, the [Runtime Guide](docs/10-tools/2-run.md) covers basic operations so you can get something running and play with the code. 

## Project Background

I am a designer/developer with broad experience with interactive computer graphics going back to 8-bit microcomputers. I started transitioning to Javascript in 2014 having seen it become more capable, but I found the actual developer experience initially very daunting. URSANODE is my collection of build systems and software patterns that I've gleaned, packaged in a form that makes it easier to start new projects from scratch. A second goal is to thoroughly document and explain how these systems work for programmers who, like me, are pretty experienced with other interactive authoring environments and enjoy seeing how Javascript can be used to express familiar concepts while introducing new ones. 

On a related note, my code formatting+lettercasing conventions differ from the de-facto "standard Javascript conventions" and are [documented here](docs/00-info/module-style.md).
