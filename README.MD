# About URSANODE

URSANODE is a collection of working code modules for Javascript interactive development in HTML5 and NodeJS.

## Quick Start

You'll need to download the repo to your working development directory. Currently I have [Macintosh Setup Instructions](docs/10-tools/1-install.md) available, though Linux and Windows 10/WSL should work similarly...I just need to confirm them.

After you get that installed, follow the [Runtime Guide](docs/10-tools/2-run.md). It covers basic running, updating, and switching between different development branches.

## Project Background

The Javascript universe has come a long way since 2010. In recent years, it started to approach feature parity with the Flash Actionscript's promise of ubiquitous multimedia, in many areas has exceeded it. For example, the browser runtime environment have had hardware accelerated 3D graphics for almost a decade, and streaming multimedia capabilities via WebRTC are starting to stabilize across all browsers. There is built-in MIDI and sound synthesis support, and with Node JS you can access centralized database and server crunching power. You can now target websites, desktops, and mobile all with the same source code and tools and get decent performance across the board. 

For all that power, the actual developer experience can be daunting to set up! URSANODE collects build system configurations and software patterns to make this easier, particularly when setting up projects from scratch. The working goal is for URSANODE to serve as both as a useful reference and as a way to collaborate with others.

I've been working with interactive computer graphics since the 1980s, and the variety of that experience is reflected in my code formatting+lettercasing conventions. They differ from standard Javascript, and are [documented here](docs/00-info/module-style.md) with an example.
