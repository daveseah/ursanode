# Javascript Simple Browser Example

This is a simple example of an HTML file that loads a single Javascript module. You can actually run this by dragging the `index,.html` into a web browser. 

A simple web server is also included, which you can start from the terminal as follows:
```
cd ~/your-path-to/ursanode/
cd ur_packages/ex-html-js
npp run server
```

#### Side Notes

- For visual consistency across browsers, the base CSS is ["normalized"][normalized] by importing `normalize.css` via the main stylesheet `style.css`. This practice was introduced in 2012.
